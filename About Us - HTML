        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
            I am a student at Millburn High School, NJ, and am very interested in plants and I have a small garden at my home. I wanted to create a website that can help people identify plants and provide them with information on how to care for them. This website
            is a result of my passion for plants and my desire to share that passion with others.

        <p>
            Our mission is to provide accessible information and resources for plant enthusiasts, gardeners, and anyone interested in learning more about the flora around them.
        </p>
        <h4>How we are unique</h4>
        <p>
            We combine technology and botany to create an interactive platform that not only educates but also engages users in the world of plants. Additionally, we provide information and photos for any plant enthusiasts and gardeners to learn and provide inspiration.
