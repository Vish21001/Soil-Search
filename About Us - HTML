  <!-- Description about me -->
  <body>
    My name is Vishisht Agarwal and I am a ninth grader at Millburn High School. I have a passion for coding and technology. I have been coding for about 1 year now and I love to create new projects and learn new things. I am also very interested in environmental science and I wanted to create a project that would help people take care of their plants and trees. I hope you enjoy using Soil Search and find it helpful!
