# Soil-Search
Welcome to Soil Search. It is our mission to keep living phenonmenon safe. Here we use scientific instruments to see the strength of the a plant's roots and see if it needs to be watered 
less or more.  This will prevent plants from dying and causing danger to other people, such as trees falling on power lines or houses.

#Soil AI
Users may take photos of ceratin plants and we will see its species and see how much water is required for that particular plant in an easily understandible and receptive response.
